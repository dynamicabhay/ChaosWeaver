# ChaosWeaver
ChaosWeaver is a plug-and-play chaos injection library for Spring Boot. It applies controlled latency, exceptions, and failures via config-driven rules and BeanPostProcessor proxies—no code changes. It integrates with CI/CD to automate Gamedays and validate service resiliency with zero developer effort.
